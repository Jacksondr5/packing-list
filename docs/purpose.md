# Packing List
This app is meant to help me pack for trips.  I have a list of things that I pack on trips, but not everything is packed for every trip.  Certain things are only packed for business trips, others for only personal trips.  Some are packed in warm weather, others in cold weather.  I also pack different things for long vs short trips.

I want it to be easy to generate a list based on the type of trip I'm taking and weather at my destination.  It would be great if the app could display the weather during my trip at my destination.

When generating the list, the app should present options (business vs personal, length of trip, mode of travel) to me.  Based on those selections, it should pull in the correct items for me to pack.  The mode of travel and length will determine the luggage I use.  The type of trip and weather will determine which items to pull in.

There is no need to store or share packing lists, they are ephemeral.  Once I start a new list, I have no need for the old list.  The items, however, should be stored, so that I can reference them again later.

This app should be mobile only, I have no need to use it on a tablet or desktop.  It should be heavily optimized for clicks so that I can quickly generate a list, quickly mark something as packed, quickly change the list, etc.

## Long term features
The following list of features are good to keep track of, but don't need to be designed for at the moment.

It would be good to connect this with my closet inventory app so that it can pull specific outfits.
