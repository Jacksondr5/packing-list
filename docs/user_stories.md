## Item Management

1.  **Add Item:** As a user, I want to add new packable items to the system, including details like name and relevant categories (e.g., clothing, toiletries, electronics), so that they are available for future packing lists.
2.  **Edit Item:** As a user, I want to edit the details of existing items (name, categories, tags) so that I can keep my master item list accurate and organized.
3.  **Delete Item:** As a user, I want to remove items from the master list that I no longer own or need, so that my item list remains relevant.
4.  **Define Item Rules:** As a user, I want to define rules or associate tags (e.g., 'business', 'personal', 'warm', 'cold', 'short trip', 'long trip', 'carry-on only') with each item, so that the app can automatically suggest relevant items when I generate a specific packing list.

## List Generation & Usage

5.  **Generate List:** As a user, I want to generate a packing list by specifying trip parameters (like type: business/personal, duration: number of days, destination/weather: warm/cold, travel mode), so that I get a tailored list of items to pack based on my predefined rules.
6.  **View Weather:** As a user, I want to input my travel destination and dates when generating a list, so that the app can display the expected weather and use it to refine the packing suggestions.
7.  **View Suggested Luggage:** As a user, I want the app to suggest appropriate luggage based on my trip's length and travel mode, so that I know which bags to use.
8.  **Mark Item as Packed:** As a user actively packing, I want to easily mark items on my generated list as packed, so that I can track my progress and ensure I don't forget anything.
9.  **Add One-off Item:** As a user actively packing, I want to add a specific item to my current generated list, even if it wasn't initially suggested by the rules, so that I can accommodate unique or last-minute needs for a particular trip.
10. **View Packing Progress:** As a user actively packing, I want to see a clear overview of which items are packed and which are remaining on my current list, so that I know what still needs to be done.
